                    <h4>Cybersecurity Passion and Approach</h4>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                        My journey into cybersecurity is driven by a deep passion for protecting data privacy and ensuring digital integrity. 
                        I'm actively exploring the multifaceted world of cybersecurity, with a particular interest in cryptography, malware analysis, 
                        and penetration testing. My approach is hands-on, emphasizing practical application and continuous learning. I am particularly 
                        interested in the way that different areas of cybersecurity interact and combine, such as how cryptography is used in malware, or 
                        how penetration testing can reveal flaws in database design.
                        </span>

                    <h4>Technical Skill and Development</h4>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                        While my career aspirations are broad, I'm eager to contribute to any role where I can leverage my growing skillset. 
                        I'm currently expanding my knowledge of network analysis with Wireshark, recognizing the importance of understanding network 
                        traffic in today's threat landscape. I find the ability to analyze network packets to be an invaluable skill in the modern world.
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                        My proficiency in Python is demonstrated through various projects, primarily focused on mathematical and computational functions. 
                        One project I'm particularly proud of involved creating a program to analyze the physics of a water tower during peak hours. This
                        project showcased my ability to apply programming logic to solve real-world problems.
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                        While my Python projects, to date, have been calculation-centric, they lay a solid foundation for more security-focused applications
                        in the future. I am aware that security focused python programs utilize libraries like Scapy, and Pycryptodome, and intend to learn them.
                            Additionally, I possess basic PowerShell scripting skills, enabling me to automate tasks and manage systems efficiently, which are valuable 
                            assets in a security context. I am interested in expanding my powershell knowledge to include more security focused scripting.
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                        "My experience with SQL extends to database design, a crucial skill for managing and securing sensitive information. I understand the
                        importance of secure database practices and am committed to learning more about database security auditing, including the use of SQL 
                        injection detection tools. I also recognize the importance of database normalization."
                        </span>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Cybersecurity Interests and Learning</h4>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                        My interest in cryptography stems from a desire to understand the fundamental principles that underpin secure communication and data
                        protection. Examples of cryptography algorithms include AES, RSA, and hash functions. I am also interested in the analysis of malware, 
                        specifically ransomware and spyware, and the techniques used to detect and mitigate these threats. I am currently studying the various 
                        methods that ransomware uses to encrypt and exfiltrate data. My experience with Kali Linux provides a foundational understanding of 
                        penetration testing tools and methodologies. I am working to improve my ability to use the tools available within Kali Linux.
