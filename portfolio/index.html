                            My proficiency in Python is demonstrated through various projects, primarily focused on mathematical and computational functions. 
                            One project I'm particularly proud of involved creating a program to analyze the physics of a water tower during peak hours. This
                            project showcased my ability to apply programming logic to solve real-world problems.

                            While my Python projects, to date, have been calculation-centric, they lay a solid foundation for more security-focused applications
                            in the future. I am aware that security focused python programs utilize libraries like Scapy, and Pycryptodome, and intend to learn them.
                                Additionally, I possess basic PowerShell scripting skills, enabling me to automate tasks and manage systems efficiently, which are valuable 
                                assets in a security context. I am interested in expanding my powershell knowledge to include more security focused scripting.

                            My experience with SQL extends to database design, a crucial skill for managing and securing sensitive information. I understand the
                            importance of secure database practices and am committed to learning more about database security auditing, including the use of SQL 
                            injection detection tools. I also recognize the importance of database normalization.
