      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        <span>"I'm Douglas Boyd and welcome to my portfolio site. I believe in a digital world where everyone can feel secure. That's 
          why I'm dedicated to cybersecurity. My approach is hands-on and driven by a genuine desire to protect data privacy. 
          I'm eager to apply my growing knowledge in Python, SQL, and PowerShell to make a tangible difference in the field.
        </span>
      </p>

      <h4>Cybersecurity Passion and Approach</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          My journey into cybersecurity is driven by a deep passion for protecting data privacy and ensuring digital integrity. 
        I'm actively exploring the multifaceted world of cybersecurity, with a particular interest in cryptography, malware analysis, 
        and penetration testing. My approach is hands-on, emphasizing practical application and continuous learning. I am particularly 
        interested in the way that different areas of cybersecurity interact and combine, such as how cryptography is used in malware, or 
        how penetration testing can reveal flaws in database design.
        </span>
      </p>

      <h4>Technical Skill and Development</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          While my career aspirations are broad, I'm eager to contribute to any role where I can leverage my growing skillset. 
          I'm currently expanding my knowledge of network analysis with Wireshark, recognizing the importance of understanding network 
          traffic in today's threat landscape. I find the ability to analyze network packets to be an invaluable skill in the modern world.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          My proficiency in Python is demonstrated through various projects, primarily focused on mathematical and computational functions. 
        One project I'm particularly proud of involved creating a program to analyze the physics of a water tower during peak hours. This
         project showcased my ability to apply programming logic to solve real-world problems.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          While my Python projects, to date, have been calculation-centric, they lay a solid foundation for more security-focused applications
           in the future. I am aware that security focused python programs utilize libraries like Scapy, and Pycryptodome, and intend to learn them.
            Additionally, I possess basic PowerShell scripting skills, enabling me to automate tasks and manage systems efficiently, which are valuable 
            assets in a security context. I am interested in expanding my powershell knowledge to include more security focused scripting.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          "My experience with SQL extends to database design, a crucial skill for managing and securing sensitive information. I understand the
           importance of secure database practices and am committed to learning more about database security auditing, including the use of SQL 
           injection detection tools. I also recognize the importance of database normalization."
        </span>
      </p>

      <h4>Cybersecurity Interests and Learning</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          My interest in cryptography stems from a desire to understand the fundamental principles that underpin secure communication and data
           protection. Examples of cryptography algorithms include AES, RSA, and hash functions. I am also interested in the analysis of malware, 
           specifically ransomware and spyware, and the techniques used to detect and mitigate these threats. I am currently studying the various 
           methods that ransomware uses to encrypt and exfiltrate data. My experience with Kali Linux provides a foundational understanding of 
           penetration testing tools and methodologies. I am working to improve my ability to use the tools available within Kali Linux.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Beyond my technical skills, I pride myself on my attention to detail and communication abilities, both essential for effective 
          cybersecurity practices. I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and staying abreast of the latest security trends. My personal
           mission is to contribute to a safer digital world by safeguarding data privacy and ensuring system integrity. I intend to continue 
           to read security blogs, and white papers to keep my skills up to date.
        </span>
      </p>

      <h4>Beyond Cybersecurity and Future Goals</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          In addition to my cybersecurity pursuits, I have a passion for design and engineering, which I express through my hobby with SolidWorks. 
          While seemingly disparate, this interest reflects my problem-solving abilities and my appreciation for the intricacies of complex systems. 
          I plan to include a page on my portfolio showcasing my SolidWorks projects, demonstrating my ability to think creatively and apply 
          technical skills in diverse contexts. I intend to include 3D renderings, and technical drawings of my projects.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          My goal is to integrate my programming skills, cybersecurity knowledge, and design aptitude to become a well-rounded and effective 
          cybersecurity professional. I am currently looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge through internships, and entry level 
          positions.
