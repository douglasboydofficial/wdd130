    <h2>Doug</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone, My name is Douglas Boyd, you can call me Doug. I live in Idaho Falls, Idaho, <br>
       but originally from Southern California. I am a junior right now majoring in cybersecurity. <br>
       I've been married to my dear wife for 3.5 year. I work at a local hospital, EIRMC in Idaho <br>
       Falls as a registrar.      
    </p>
    <p>
        My favorite scripture is 2 Nephi 4:16-23. In this scripture, we see Nephi feel inadequate to <br>
        praise the Lord because of Nephi's iniquities, but he does it anyways. How many times do we <br>
        want to shrink away from the Lord just like Nephi because of our flaws? I know I do, and I feel <br>
         like it is so relatable.
